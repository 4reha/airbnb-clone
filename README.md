# Airbnb Clone - MERN Stack

This repository contains the source code for an Airbnb clone built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It offers a platform for users to list and book properties, providing a seamless experience similar to Airbnb. The project includes features such as user authentication, property listings, booking management, messaging, and reviews. Built with scalability and extensibility in mind, this clone serves as a foundation for creating a full-fledged rental marketplace.
